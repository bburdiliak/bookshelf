**TL;DR Good motivational book that will help you become an exceptional software developer.**

To be honest, based on the title of the book *Soft skills: The software developer's life manual* I thought it would be a little bit different. I expected it to be a little bit more focused on communication, socialization, making valuable contacts and so on. 

So if the book is not about communication, what is it about? It is a selection of small and focused chapters that might be divided into seven big topics: Career, Marketing yourself, Learning, Productivity, Finances, Fitness and Spirit. In each part several aspects of the topic are discussed.

It starts with a career topic, that will tell you how to behave when interviewing for a job, how to negotiate the money or how to decide whether freelancing is the right choice for you. For me the most inspirational part was "How to market yourself". You might be an exceptional software developer but if nobody knows about it, nobody cares. The author talks about importance of having a blog and a presence on social networks - the book gives you information about how often you should post and what. I also care about productivity, which is another big topic of the book. I kind of liked the idea of having a routine and learning new routines to be better. It also discusses the pomodoro technique that I am successfully using for some time. The financial section of the book anticipated developers to invest into real estate which is something I have been thinking about... But this topic in particular was a little bit focused on people from America - some of the items discussed here would not be true in Czech republic where I am living.

But there are some weaker parts as well. I am not that spiritual person so the last section focusing on spirit was a little bit disappointing. Also I am a little bit worried if the book is still up to date in few years since it contains many real-world references and products (like FitBit and so on).

Overall I liked the book and I think it is not necessary to read it from cover to cover - the topics are not connected so picking just the parts you are interested it is absolutely OK.
